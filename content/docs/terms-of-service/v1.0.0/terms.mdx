By (a) purchasing access to the Service through an online ordering process that references this Agreement, (b) clicking a box indicating acceptance, or (c) entering into a separate written agreement or Master Services Agreement (MSA) that incorporates these Terms by reference, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

### 1.1 Service Description

ELLA provides a cloud-based software service designed to help business advisors and their clients plan and execute business exits (the "Service"). The Service includes functionality for managing client engagements through Workbenches, using templates and frameworks to create customized deliverables, and visualizing aspects of business value and transition.

Any data, documents, or content you or your users upload, input, or share through the platform are considered "User Data" and remain your responsibility, as further detailed in Section 9. The Service also includes access to prebuilt templates, visual diagrams (such as the Valuation Diagram), help documentation, and other proprietary tools (collectively, "ELLA Content").

The Service may include features powered by artificial intelligence ("AI"), which allow Users to generate content, summaries, or suggestions based on submitted AI Inputs. Users acknowledge that AI Outputs are generated automatically and may not be reviewed by humans before delivery.

You will not receive access to the underlying source code or software of the Service, nor do you acquire any ownership in the software platform itself.

## 2. Modular Policies

These Terms incorporate the following policies by reference and work together to govern your use of the Service:

- Privacy Policy
- Acceptable Use Policy
- Data Processing Addendum (DPA)

In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any incorporated policy, (1) these Terms shall take precedence, except for when a User is subject to Data Protection Laws and has entered into a DPA with ELLA, in which case terms set forth in the DPA take precedence over these Terms, and (2), all referenced policies remain valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.

We may update these policies at any time without prior notice. Continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the modified policies.

## 3. Eligibility and Scope
### 3.1 Eligibility

Use of ELLA is permitted only by Users who (a) are acting on behalf of a business or other legal entity, (b) have the authority to bind that entity, and (c) are at least 16 years of age. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet these criteria and that your use of the Service complies with applicable laws, including data protection regulations where relevant.

### 3.2 Restrictions

You may not use the Service if you are located in a country subject to U.S. sanctions or are listed on any U.S. government denied-party list.

## 4. Account Structure & Access

Advisors create Organizations and can add client businesses as Workspaces, inviting Business Owners, Exit Team Members, or other Users to collaborate. Each Advisor is responsible for configuring the access levels and permissions of all Users they invite. Users must maintain the confidentiality of their login credentials and are fully responsible for any activity conducted through their accounts. ELLA does not manage or oversee individual permissions, access roles, or account activityâ€”these responsibilities fall solely on the Advisor or Organization that initiated the invitation.

## 5. Subscriptions, Fees, and Billing
### 5.1 Subscription

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Customer may purchase a subscription to, and has the right to access and use, the Service as specified in one or more ordering screens agreed to by the parties through ELLA's website that reference this Agreement and describe the business terms related to Customer's subscription ("**Order(s)**"). All subscriptions will be for the period described on the applicable Order ("**Subscription Period**"). Use of and access to the Service is permitted only by individuals authorized by Customer and for Customer's own internal business purposes and not for the benefit of any third party ("**Users**").

### 5.2 Fees
- Use AI Outputs to generate or disseminate defamatory, discriminatory, unlawful, or harmful content;
- Use AI features to impersonate others or create deceptive, fraudulent, or misleading content;
- Employ AI tools for medical diagnosis, legal advice, or automated decision-making with regulatory consequences;
- Attempt to extract training data or reverse-engineer model behavior;
- Upload content that contains personal or protected health information (PHI) into AI features without appropriate legal basis and safeguards.

## 8. Data Ownership & Collaboration
### 8.1 Data Ownership

Users retain ownership of any data or content they upload or input. In shared Workspaces or collaborative spaces, the uploading user retains ownership unless otherwise agreed between users.

### 8.2 Confidentiality

Users must respect the confidentiality of all shared information. ELLA is not a party to any confidentiality agreement between Users.

### 8.3 Exit Team Permissions

When an Advisor chooses to invite other members of the Exit Team, they become solely responsible for setting and managing permissions and access levels for those Exit Team members. ELLA does not manage access on behalf of Users and assumes no responsibility or liability for permissions granted to, or activities conducted by, Exit Team members or other Users. All such access and configuration is the responsibility of the Advisor or Organization.

## 9. Intellectual Property
### 9.1 ELLA's Materials

ELLA retains all rights in the Service, its features, designs, documentation, templates, proprietary display methods (e.g., Valuation Diagram, Value Chain), and anything else provided by ELLA to the Customer (collectively, the "ELLA Materials").

### 9.2 ELLA's Intellectual Property

ELLA retains all right, title, and interest (including, without limitation, all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property rights) in and to the ELLA Materials, all related and underlying technology, and any updates, enhancements, upgrades, modifications, patches, workarounds, and derivative works thereof. There are no implied licenses under this Agreement, and any rights not expressly granted to the Customer are expressly reserved by ELLA.

### 9.3 Ownership of Deliverables

Users retain ownership of their own data and Customized Deliverables. However, unmodified templates and visual frameworks remain the intellectual property of ELLA.

### 9.4 Ownership of AI Inputs and Outputs

Users retain ownership of all AI Inputs submitted through the Service. Subject to applicable law, Users may use AI Outputs for their internal business purposes. ELLA disclaims ownership of AI Outputs, except to the extent such Outputs contain or reflect proprietary ELLA IP.

### 9.5 Restrictions on Use of Inputs and Outputs by ELLA

ELLA will not use AI Inputs or AI Outputs to train or improve AI models, except in anonymized and aggregated form for performance and security purposes. Users should avoid uploading sensitive data unless necessary for the intended business use.

## 10. Confidentiality
### 10.1 Definition

Each party (the "Receiving Party") may receive non-public business, technical, or financial information from the other party (the "Disclosing Party") that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential, including but not limited to information about products, business plans, users, systems, security practices, and pricing ("Confidential Information"). ELLA's Confidential Information includes non-public details of the Service's features, functionality, and performance. Customer's Confidential Information includes User Data, User Submissions, and any business planning content input into the platform. This Agreement and all Order details are considered Confidential Information of both parties. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available without breach; (b) was known by the Receiving Party without restriction before disclosure; (c) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation; or (d) is independently developed without use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.

### 10.2 Protection and Use

The Receiving Party agrees to: (a) use reasonable care (no less than that used to protect its own similar information) to safeguard the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information; (b) use the Confidential Information solely to fulfill obligations or exercise rights under this Agreement; and (c) not disclose it to any third party except to its Representatives who need to know such information and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those in this Agreement. Disclosure of this Agreement and general deal terms to potential investors, acquirers, or legal/financial advisors is permitted, provided they are subject to standard confidentiality obligations.

### 10.3 Compelled Access or Disclosure

If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information, it will provide advance notice (to the extent permitted by law) and reasonable cooperation to the Disclosing Party to seek protective treatment.

### 10.4 Feedback

Customer may from time to time provide suggestions, comments, or other feedback with respect to the Service ("Feedback"). For the avoidance of doubt, Feedback will only refer to suggestions, comments or other feedback provided to ELLA specifically regarding the Service and will not include User Information or User Submissions. ELLA may use such Feedback freely and without restriction to use, disclose, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, display, and otherwise distribute and exploit any Feedback as ELLA sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind, provided ELLA does not publicly attribute Feedback to Customer without consent.

## 11. Aggregated Data and Logging
### 11.1 Monitoring and Logging

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, ELLA may monitor Customer's use of the Services and collect and compile Aggregated Data. ELLA also reserves the right to log usage activity, access patterns, and performance data for security, support, and compliance purposes, including detection of misuse or system anomalies.

### 11.2 Data Use and Ownership
## 14. Warranty Disclaimer, Limitations, and Liability

The ELLA IP is provided "as is" without warranties of any kindâ€”express, implied, statutory, or otherwise. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and uninterrupted or error-free use. Customer acknowledges that ELLA's Services are intended solely to assist in strategic planning and documentation related to business exits. The Services do not constitute legal, financial, valuation, or compliance advice. Use of the Service is at your own risk.

Except for the following ("**Excluded Liabilities**"): (i) breach of confidentiality, (ii) indemnification obligations, and (iii) gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct:

- Neither party will be liable under any theory of lawâ€”whether contract, tort, or otherwiseâ€”for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, loss of revenue, profits, or business opportunities, reputational harm, loss or corruption of data, business interruption or system downtime, or costs of substitute goods or services, even if the possibility of such damages was known or foreseeable.
- The total liability of either party for any claim under this Agreement will not exceed the total fees paid by Customer to ELLA in the twelve (12) months prior to the event giving rise to the claim. For Excluded Liabilities, the liability cap is increased to three times (3x) the fees paid during that same period.
- ELLA is not liable for losses arising from Customer's or Users' reliance on outputs generated within the platform, including templates, visualizations, or collaborative planning tools. This includes, without limitation, misconfigured access controls, improper sharing of confidential materials, or third-party collaboration initiated by Customers or their authorized Users.
- These limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless otherwise agreed in a written Order Form or custom agreement between the parties.

## 15. Termination

You may cancel your subscription at any time. As noted in Section 6 above, ELLA may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms or non-payment.

Upon termination:
- You retain ownership of your data
- Access to the Services will be revoked
- ELLA will delete User Data in accordance with our data retention policy

## 16. Publicity

ELLA may identify you as a customer and use your name and logo on ELLA's website and in ELLA's marketing materials unless you opt out via written request.

## 17. Miscellaneous
### 17.1 Assignment

Neither party may assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law, or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld). Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this section is null and void and will not relieve the assigning or delegating party of its obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign this Agreement in its entirety, including all Orders, without the other party's consent in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. This Agreement is binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

### 17.2 Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be severed and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. The parties will work in good faith to replace any invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid provision that most closely reflects the original intent.

### 17.3 Changes

ELLA may update these Terms from time to time to reflect updates to the Service or changes in the law. When we do so, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of these Terms. Your continued use of the Service following such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using the Service. For Customers with a separately executed Master Services Agreement, material changes to these Terms will not apply until renewal unless otherwise agreed.

### 17.4 Relationship Between Parties
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create any partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between the parties. Each party is an independent contractor and not an agent or representative of the other. Neither party has the authority to bind the other to any third party.

### 17.5 No Third-Party Beneficiaries

There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. No third party shall have any rights or obligations under this Agreement, including under any incorporated documents, except where expressly stated.

### 17.6 Email Communications

Notices under this Agreement will be provided as follows: (a) all notices regarding the Service will be sent by email, (b) notices to ELLA must be sent to hello@exitwithella.io, and (c) all notices to Customer will be sent to the email(s) provided through the Service. Notices will be deemed to have been duly given the business day after it is sent. You are responsible for keeping your contact information up to date.

### 17.7 Amendments and Waivers

No modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed (or acknowledged electronically) by the party against whom the modification or waiver is asserted. A waiver of any breach or default will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.

### 17.8 Conflicts with MSAs

In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the terms of a fully executed Master Services Agreement (MSA) between the parties, the MSA shall govern with respect to the subject matter of the conflict.

### 17.9 Force Majeure

ELLA will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement due to events beyond its reasonable control. This includes, but is not limited to, natural disasters, acts of government, terrorism, war, labor disruptions (excluding those involving ELLA's own employees), shortages, internet or utility outages, or failures by third-party service providers. ELLA will make reasonable efforts to resume performance as soon as possible following such an event.

### 17.10 Governing Law & Venue

This Agreement, and any disputes arising out of or related hereto, will be governed exclusively by the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules or the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The state and federal courts located in Erie County, Pennsylvania will have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its formation, interpretation, or enforcement. Each party hereby consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. Each party also hereby waives any right to jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to this Agreement. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney's fees.

### 17.11 Entire Agreement
